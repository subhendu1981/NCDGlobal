# How to run the model

Running the model requires two scripts in the 'NCD_Python_Code' folder, the 'main_script.py' and the 'parameters.py'. 
The first script is for decribing and running the model, while the second script contains all the parameter values.

Running the code also need three '.csv' data files: 'Size_vs_halfsaturation_NO3_uptake', 'Size_vs_NO3_uptake', 
and 'viscocity_temperature_Jumars_1993'. These '.csv' files are also included in the folder 'NCD_Python_Code'.
